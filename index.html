      <h2>Plantin establishes a business as a printer</h2>
      <p>In 1555, Plantin set up as a printer. He may have initially obtained financial support from the heterodox sect known as
      the <b>‘Huis der Liefde’</b> (‘House of Love’), and later – from 1563 onwards – from Calvinist partners. With this support he
      developed his business into the largest typographical undertaking of the second half of the 16th century.</p>

      <h2>Plantin suspected of hersey</h2>
      <p>The second half of the 16th century was no easy time for writers and their printer-publishers. Religious intolerance was
      rife. The Southern Netherlands were under Spanish control, so Roman Catholicism was imposed. In 1562, Plantin got into
      trouble when a <b>Calvinist pamphlet</b> was discovered during a raid on his print shop. The bad news reached Plantin while he
      was on a business trip. To escape persecution, he remained in Paris for a year and a half until his name was cleared. In
      September 1563, he returned to Antwerp, where all his furniture had in the meantime been sold to the public. But
      presumably the creditors/wholesale buyers were friends of Plantin, who managed to ensure that the government did not
      impound his property. They subsequently became his <b>partners</b>.</p>

      <h2>Plantin's Unstoppable Rise</h2>
      <p>Back in Antwerp, Plantin received the support of some wealthy local financiers, who saw the energetic entrepreneur as a
      sound investment. The Officina Plantiniana, which had already moved several times due to lack of space, became a
      ‘compagnie’. Over a period of five years, the presses, which Plantin purchased second-hand, printed some <b>260
      publications</b>.</p>

      <h2>Back in danger</h2>
      <p>This collaboration came to an end in 1567. Plantin’s partners, who were convinced Calvinists, fled the Netherlands just
      before the arrival of the Duke of Alba. But the real danger to Plantin lay in Vianen, near Utrecht. In this Calvinist
      stronghold, Plantin secretly helped to establish an anti-Spanish printing works. This act of high treason could have
      cost him his head.</p>

      <h2>The polyglot Bible</h2>
      <p>To clear himself of all suspicion, Plantin sang the praises of the Catholic Church in letters to powerful protectors in
      this period. He developed a plan that he suspected would be of interest to the ultra-Catholic King Philip II: a
      scholarly edition of the Biblical texts that would be the largest polyglot (multilingual) Bible of the 16th century.
      The plan worked: in September 1567, Plantin learned that Philip II was willing to provide financial support. In March
      1568, the king sent the great Spanish theologian and humanist Benedictus Arias Montanus to Antwerp to oversee the
      publication. Five years later, in 1573, the giant project was completed: an edition of the Bible in five languages and
      eight monumental volumes... a truly ‘royal’ Bible or Biblia regia.</p>

      <h2>Arch-printer to the king of Spain</h2>
      <p>The largest printing business of the age brought its printer an honorary title in 1570, while work was still in progress
      on the Biblia regia: Arch-Printer to the King. Aristocratic associates also secured lucrative contracts for him in 1571
      for the printing of missals, breviaries and other religious mass products for the Spanish market and its colonies.</p>
